# Design Review: Botim Quest

*Generated on 2026-01-06*

---

## 1. Intended Flow (from PRD)

*No explicit "Happy path" section found in PRD. Please document the main user journey.*

## 2. Expected Screens (inferred)

- [ ] 1. Overview
- [ ] 9. UX Flows
- [ ] UX1 — Quest Discovery (Homepage / Money Page)
- [ ] UX2 — Quest Detail Page
- [ ] 12. Edge Cases & Unhappy Flows

## 3. States Checklist

Every screen should account for these states:

- [ ] **Happy path** — The ideal user journey
- [ ] **Empty** — No data, first-time user, or cleared state
- [ ] **Loading** — Waiting for data or action completion
- [ ] **Error** — Something went wrong (network, validation, permissions)
- [ ] **Recovery** — How the user gets back on track

## 4. Gaps & Risks

### Edge cases identified in PRD:

- ⚠️ No available quests → hide quest section
- ⚠️ Multiple rewards triggering incorrectly
- ⚠️ Cashback triggered multiple times
- ⚠️ Campaign misconfiguration
- ⚠️ Quest expiry during active view
- ⚠️ Translation handling (Arabic)
- ⚠️ Cohort sync issues
- ⚠️ Campaign pause / termination scenarios

### Common gaps to check:

- [ ] Offline behavior
- [ ] Permission denied states
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Rate limiting / throttling
- [ ] Accessibility considerations

## 5. Suggestions

Based on the PRD analysis:

1. **Document the happy path** — Add a "Happy path" section to your PRD with numbered steps.

## 6. Figma Make Prompt

Use this prompt with Figma's AI features to scaffold your prototype:

```
Create a prototype skeleton for "Botim Quest" with the following flow:

Screens needed: 1. Overview, 9. UX Flows, UX1 — Quest Discovery (Homepage / Money Page), UX2 — Quest Detail Page, 12. Edge Cases & Unhappy Flows

Include frames for:
- 1. Overview
- 9. UX Flows
- UX1 — Quest Discovery (Homepage / Money Page)
- UX2 — Quest Detail Page
- 12. Edge Cases & Unhappy Flows

For each screen, add placeholder states:
- Default (happy path)
- Empty state
- Loading state
- Error state

Focus on flow and structure, not visual polish.
