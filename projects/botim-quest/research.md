What feels “worth it”:

## Exclusive / Special Benefits

Appeal is mixed:

  - 1–2 times/month (majority)
  - Avg monthly amount: ~AED 10,550

Impact of rewards:
- Would remit more often if rewards exist (3/5)
- Still remit only when needed (2/5)

Some users said they might:
- Remit on behalf of friends/colleagues to earn rewards

---

## Motivation Drivers

Primary motivator:
- **Saving money / cashback** (4/5)

Secondary:
- Gifts / rewards (1/5)

👉 Insight: Messaging should emphasize **money saved**, not “gamification”.

---

## Usability & Terminology Issues (Critical)

### Terminology Confusion
- “Quest” → **unclear for most users**
- “Remit” → partially understood; users prefer **“Send Money”**
- Task wording caused confusion:
  - “Send 2,500 AED” interpreted as multiple transactions by some users

### Card & Task Structure
- Card A vs Card B generally understood after explanation
- Some users thought **both tasks must be completed**, not one
- Progress indicators sometimes misinterpreted

### Voucher Visibility
- Voucher concept understood *after discovery*
- Entry point inside Rewards Center was hard to find
- Term “Voucher” felt unattractive / not noticeable
- Status labels (Active / Expired) were clear only after discovery

---

## Key Risks Identified

- Gamified language (“Quest”) creates friction instead of motivation
- Users misinterpret task logic (single vs multiple actions)
- Rewards may be “invisible” even when earned
- Users may abandon flow due to unclear progress / status

---

## Design Implications for Botim Quest

- Replace technical or game-like terms with **plain, action-based language**
- Make cashback value explicit and prominent
- Clarify task rules unambiguously (e.g. “Send AED 2,500 once”)
- Improve reward discovery and visibility
- Do not rely on vouchers or VIP benefits as primary hooks

---

## Open Questions (from Research)

- Should “Quest” be renamed entirely?
- How do we communicate reward value early without clutter?
- How can progress logic be made obvious without explanation?
- Should voucher rewards be deprioritized vs cashback in MVP?
