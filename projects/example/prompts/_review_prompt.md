# Superdesigner Review Prompt

Read `_review_context.md` in this folder and generate the design review documents.

## Step 1: Fetch Figma Design Context (if available)

If the context file contains a Figma URL with fileKey and nodeId:

1. Use `mcp_Figma_get_design_context` to fetch the actual design structure
2. Compare the Figma frames against the PRD happy path
3. Note any missing screens or states in your review

This gives you real design data to validate against the PRD.

## Rules (STRICT)

1. **Do NOT invent requirements** — only use what's in the context file + Figma MCP data
2. **Be specific** — reference actual steps, screens, and edge cases from the PRD
3. **Cross-reference Figma** — if you fetched design context, compare it to the PRD flow
4. **Be actionable** — every suggestion should be something the designer can do
5. **Use the templates exactly** — follow the structure provided below

## Output (EXACTLY two files)

Create these files in the parent project folder (`projects/example/`):

### 1. `design-review.md`

Use this EXACT template:

```markdown
# Design Review: <Project Name>

*Generated on <DATE>*

---

## 1. Intended Flow (from PRD)

<List the happy path steps as numbered list>

## 2. Expected Screens (inferred)

<List screens as checkboxes>

## 3. States Checklist

Every screen should account for these states:

- [ ] **Happy path** — The ideal user journey
- [ ] **Empty** — No data, first-time user, or cleared state
- [ ] **Loading** — Waiting for data or action completion
- [ ] **Error** — Something went wrong (network, validation, permissions)
- [ ] **Recovery** — How the user gets back on track

## 4. Gaps & Risks

### Edge cases identified:
<List edge cases with ⚠️ prefix>

### Common gaps to check:
- [ ] Offline behavior
- [ ] Permission denied states
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Rate limiting / throttling
- [ ] Accessibility considerations

## 5. Suggestions

<3-5 actionable suggestions based on the analysis>

## 6. Figma Make Prompt

```
Create a prototype skeleton for "<Project Name>".

## Context
<Overview from PRD>

## Problem
<Problem statement from PRD>

## Goals
<Goals from PRD as bullets>

## User Flow
<Happy path steps as numbered list>

## Required Frames
<List of screens>

## States (for each screen)
- Default (happy path)
- Empty state
- Loading state
- Error state

Focus on flow and structure, not visual polish.
```

*Review generated by Superdesigner*

```

### 2. `design-comments.preview.md`

Use this EXACT template:

```markdown
# Design Comments Preview
Project: <Project Name>
Generated: <DATE>

---

## Comment 1
Target:
  page: <Screen name>
  frame: (optional)
  nodeId: <Node ID if available>

Type:
  <Missing State | Flow Mismatch | Edge Case | Validation | Clarifying Question>

Message:
<The actual comment text - be specific and actionable>

Why:
<Reference to PRD section or UX principle>

---

<Repeat for 3-7 comments total>

*Total: X comments*
*Run `npm run comment -- <slug>` to post to Figma.*

```

## Instructions

1. Read the context file to understand the project
2. Generate `design-review.md` with:
   - Intended flow from the happy path steps
   - Expected screens inferred from PRD headings
   - Edge cases listed under Gaps & Risks
   - Figma Make prompt with full project context
3. Generate `design-comments.preview.md` with:
   - 3-7 high-signal comments
   - Focus on missing states, edge cases, and clarifying questions
   - Include nodeId if available from context
4. Replace all `<placeholders>` with actual content
5. Replace `<DATE>` with: 2026-01-06
6. Replace `<Project Name>` with: Daily Check-in Feature

## After generation

Run `npm run comment -- example --dry-run` to preview Figma comments.
