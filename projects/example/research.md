# Research Notes

## Summary

- Users want quick, frictionless check-ins (under 30 seconds)
- Streaks are highly motivating but can cause anxiety if broken
- Morning check-ins have 2x higher completion vs evening

## User pain points

1. Existing mood trackers are too complex
2. Users forget to log consistently
3. Historical data isn't actionable

## Competitor analysis

| Competitor | Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Daylio | Emoji + activities | Fast entry | No insights |
| Reflectly | AI journaling | Personalized | Too long |
| Pixels | Year-in-pixels | Visual appeal | No trends |

## User quotes

> "I want to do it but I always forget. By night I can't remember how I felt in the morning."
> — Power user, interview #12

> "I gave up on [competitor] because it took too long. I just want to tap and go."
> — Churned user, exit survey

## Quantitative data

- 73% of users who check in 3+ days become weekly actives
- Morning notifications have 2.1x open rate vs evening
- Average competitor check-in time: 47 seconds

## Recommendations

1. Target sub-15-second completion time
2. Send morning reminders (8-9am local)
3. Show streak prominently but offer "streak freeze" to reduce anxiety
