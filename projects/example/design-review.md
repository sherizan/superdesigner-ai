# Design Review: Daily Check-in Feature

*Generated on 2026-01-06*

---

## 1. Intended Flow (from PRD)

1. User opens app and sees check-in prompt
2. User taps "Start Check-in" button
3. User answers mood question (emoji selector)
4. User answers productivity question (1-5 scale)
5. User adds optional note
6. User taps "Complete" button
7. User sees confirmation with streak count
8. User can view trends dashboard

## 2. Expected Screens (inferred)

- [ ] Overview

## 3. States Checklist

Every screen should account for these states:

- [ ] **Happy path** — The ideal user journey
- [ ] **Empty** — No data, first-time user, or cleared state
- [ ] **Loading** — Waiting for data or action completion
- [ ] **Error** — Something went wrong (network, validation, permissions)
- [ ] **Recovery** — How the user gets back on track

## 4. Gaps & Risks

### Edge cases identified in PRD:

- ⚠️ User tries to check in twice in one day
- ⚠️ User's timezone changes during travel
- ⚠️ User has no internet when completing check-in
- ⚠️ User abandons check-in midway
- ⚠️ User wants to edit a previous check-in

### Common gaps to check:

- [ ] Offline behavior
- [ ] Permission denied states
- [ ] Session timeout handling
- [ ] Rate limiting / throttling
- [ ] Accessibility considerations

## 5. Suggestions

Based on the PRD analysis:

1. Review each edge case against your Figma screens.
2. Ensure all states in the checklist are designed.
3. Consider adding loading skeletons for better perceived performance.

## 6. Figma Make Prompt

Use this prompt with Figma's AI features to scaffold your prototype:

```
Create a prototype skeleton for "Daily Check-in Feature" with the following flow:

Main flow:
1. User opens app and sees check-in prompt
2. User taps "Start Check-in" button
3. User answers mood question (emoji selector)
4. User answers productivity question (1-5 scale)
5. User adds optional note
6. User taps "Complete" button
7. User sees confirmation with streak count
8. User can view trends dashboard

Include frames for:
- Overview

For each screen, add placeholder states:
- Default (happy path)
- Empty state
- Loading state
- Error state

Focus on flow and structure, not visual polish.
```
