# Superdesigner AI

**Design review, before design review happens.**

Superdesigner turns fragmented design artifacts  
(PRDs, research, Figma files) into **clear, actionable design feedback** — *before* things ship.

No UI generation.  
No visual critique.  
Just fewer missed states and late surprises.

---

## Why this exists

Every design project looks “done” until review.

- PRDs live in PDFs  
- Research lives in decks  
- Designs live in Figma  

That’s where gaps hide.

**Superdesigner connects intent across artifacts and surfaces what’s missing.**

---

## What it is

- 🧠 Cursor-native AI workflow for designers  
- 📋 Deterministic design review (flows, states, edge cases)  
- 🔍 Reviews **intent**, not pixels  

**What it is NOT**
- ❌ UI generator  
- ❌ Figma replacement  
- ❌ Style critique tool  

---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- **Cursor**
- **Figma MCP** — [Add to Cursor](https://cursor.directory/mcp/figma)

---

## 60-second start
1. Open your terminal

```bash
npx degit sherizan/superdesigner-ai my-superdesigner
cd my-superdesigner
npm install
cursor .
```

2. Open Cursor's built-in terminal

```bash
npm run new -- "My Project"
```

It will create the necessary files.

3. Add your Figma design to figma.md.

4. Add your documents

Drop raw files into `/raw`:
- PRDs (DOCS / PDF)
- Research decks (PPTX / PDF)
- Notes (MD / TXT)

Run:
```bash
npm run convert -- my-project
```

Superdesigner normalizes them for review.

---

5. Run the design review
```bash
npm run review -- my-project
```

## What you get

- `design-review.md`
  - Intended flow
  - Expected screens
  - States checklist
  - Gaps & risks
  - Clear next steps

- `design-comments.preview.md`
  - Ready-to-post Figma comments (generated by review)
  - Calm, specific, actionable
  - Preview locally, then post to Figma with `npm run comment`

6. Open the generated `_superdesigner_*_prompt.md` files and run them with **Cursor Agent**. Just type @ to mention the file and hit enter

Then post comments to Figma automatically:

```bash
npm run comment -- my-project
```

And you're done!
