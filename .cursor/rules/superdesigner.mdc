# Superdesigner Review Rules

**Superdesigner reviews intent, not pixels.**

## Figma MCP (REQUIRED)

**You MUST use Figma MCP tools to analyze designs:**

1. Read `projects/<slug>/context/figma.md` to get Figma URLs
2. Extract fileKey and nodeId from each URL
3. Use `mcp_Figma_get_metadata` to get nested frame structure
4. Use `mcp_Figma_get_design_context` on key screens
5. Use nested screen nodeIds (not parent frames) for comments

This ensures comments are pinned to specific screens in Figma, not just parent frames.

## File Access Contract

### READ ONLY
- `projects/<slug>/context/*` - User-provided context files
- `.superdesigner/templates/*` - Output format templates

### WRITE ONLY
- `projects/<slug>/insights/*` - Generated review outputs

### DO NOT MODIFY
- `.superdesigner/` - Engine code (except reading templates)
- `package.json`
- `node_modules/`

## Output Files

Generate exactly two files:

### 1. design-review.md
**Follow the format in:** `.superdesigner/templates/design-review.template.md`

Key sections:
- Executive Summary
- PRD Alignment (✅ Covered / ❓ Missing)
- States Review (per flow: Happy, Empty, Loading, Error, Recovery)
- Edge Cases (Offline, Permissions, Session, Accessibility, etc.)
- Research Findings Alignment
- Analytics Assumptions
- Recommendations (P0/P1/P2)
- Questions for Design Team

### 2. design-comments.preview.md
**IMPORTANT**: Follow the EXACT format in `.superdesigner/templates/design-comments.template.md`

- Use `## Comment N` headers
- Include all required fields: page, frame, nodeId, Type, Message, Why
- Limit to 10 most important comments

## Review Checklists

### States (every screen)
- [ ] Happy path
- [ ] Empty state
- [ ] Loading state
- [ ] Error state
- [ ] Recovery path

### Edge Cases
- Offline behavior
- Permission denied
- Session timeout
- Rate limiting
- Accessibility

### PRD Alignment
- Does each PRD step have a screen?
- Are all goals addressed?
- Are edge cases covered?

## Tone

1. **Direct** — State observations clearly
2. **Question-based** — Frame gaps as questions
3. **Concise** — One idea per comment
4. **Actionable** — Suggest what to do
